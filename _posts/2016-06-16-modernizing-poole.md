Let me be honest here, [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) is not the most innovative and best theme out there. However, it does promise a lot with it's simplistic design. So I went ahead and took steps even further: I customized it—I essentially made it my own. The design I'm using for this blog is directly taken from [Dustin Curtis'](https://dcurt.is/) blog. The only similarity is the blunt use of the color black and white, which I think is really the best use for contrasting material you want to stand out. Being a careful typography man, I decided to do research on what the standards are, regarding legibility. The results are what made this site standout. The elegant use of typography creates about 98% of the visual wonders you see here.

This blog is off to a fresh start. The final design is nowhere what you see now. I just wanted to deploy this and keep it up, while I work on a better design offline.
